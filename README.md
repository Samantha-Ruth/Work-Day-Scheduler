# Work-Day-Scheduler
Calendar Application

## Description

This project's goal was to create a calendar application with dynamic events using by jQuery, as well as incorporating Moment (or an application like Moment) into the code. The application should show working hours on the left and have a space to write in upcoming/current/past events in the middle of the screen. The color of the working hours should change based on whether they are in the future, the current hour, or in the past. The events should be stored in local storage on the browser and stay on the applicaton even when the browser is refreshed.

This project helped me further understand jQuery and bootstrap as well as reviewing and relearning concenpts in vanilla javascript.  I am having some trouble with local storage, as well as connecting the current time with the time elements on the side,  but am continuing to work through it.
